    Phoenix has unprecedented time resolution in its outputs.  
    here, analyze P3 star forming regions through time.

    For each star forming region we can track, as fn of time:
        enriched volume
        n_stars
        n_sn
        rho-t hist
        rho-h2 hist
        rho-z hist
        rho-e- hist
        change in momentum?

    Based on experience with NovaNet, MSNet, we can restrict the SFR to the 100 kpccm region about the first star, 
    and will only lose some ionized region at the outer reaches.
