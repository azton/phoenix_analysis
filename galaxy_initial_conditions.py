    For a star forming galaxy, what is the first star?
        first star -> mass of stars
        first star -> time of formation
        first star -> delay of P2 onset

    Since P3 star formation is clustered and has coeval clusters:
        first star region -> mass of stars
        first star region -> delay of P2 onset

    Can P3 regions be classified based on, e.g., number of P3, type of P3, etc?
