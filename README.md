### Phoenix analysis

This contains all analysis for the Phoenix simulations performed by Azton Wells.

If you have ever thought "I wish my cosmological simulation had more time resolution in these outputs so that I could answer *THE BURNING QUESTION HERE*," then these are the simulations for you.  They mimic the Renaissance simulations (https://rensimlab.github.io) in terms of parameters and resolution, with updated Population III star formation characteristic masses and refined stellar feedback deposition.  They have been used to generate training data for first-of-their-kind deep learning models to generate models of primordial star formation and feedback (e.g., https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01358).

Enjoy!
